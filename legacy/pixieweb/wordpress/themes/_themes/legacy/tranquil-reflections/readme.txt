Tranquil Reflections - Wordpress theme by liight http://www.liight.com

This theme is free for use and modification. Please keep the links in the footer but don't feel legally obliged to.

Big thanks to garinungkadol and ArnoldGoodway at wordpress for reviewing my theme and helping me get it into WP3 shape. I really appreciate your efforts. ('Next Entries' link is meant to be beside the 'Previous Entries' link, thanks for checking)

The main menu has a limited room for links, Once you exceed this space, the menu will break in appearance. Use child pages in the sidebar and the 'pages' widget if you want more menu items.

Most of the code originated from the wonderful, Blass theme http://1000ff.de/wordpress-theme-blass-english-version/ but I have brought the theme constraints up to Word Press 3.0 
I created the css from scratch as a learning exercise, if there are things that need to be added, please go to liight.com.au/free-things-2/wordpress-theme-free-download-and-use-on-whatever-you-want/

This theme has been created to make it easier for other desigers like me, who might be light on with programming but want a theme that is easy to mofiy with css alone.

Many thanks for choosing my theme.
